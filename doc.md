# DevOps Progress Report (Past 1.5 Months)

## Overview
During the past one and a half months as a DevOps engineer, I have worked on multiple initiatives to improve the development and deployment processes. My focus has been on infrastructure management, deployment automation, developer collaboration, and best practices adoption.

## Accomplishments

### 1. **Development Server Setup**
- Successfully ran a development server to support the ongoing projects and provide a stable environment for testing and debugging.

### 2. **WebSocket Fix for Raad Project**
- Diagnosed and resolved WebSocket issues in the Raad Project to ensure real-time communication functionality.

### 3. **Dockerizing the Raad Project**
- Re-established the Raad Project as a fully dockerized application for better deployment and scalability.

### 4. **Portainer Setup for Developer Access**
- Deployed and configured Portainer to provide developers with controlled access to frontend, backend, and database containers.

### 5. **Sentry Implementation for Issue Tracking**
- Set up Sentry to collect and monitor application issues, improving debugging and error resolution.

### 6. **Git & GitLab Collaboration Guidance**
- Guided developers on best practices for Git and GitLab usage to streamline collaboration and code management.

### 7. **Harbor Registry Deployment**
- Implemented Harbor as a private registry for storing and managing container images.
- Enabled versioned releases by pushing images to the registry for structured deployments.

### 8. **Postman API Collection**
- Created a centralized Postman collection to store and manage all API endpoints for better API testing and documentation.

### 9. **Docker Training for Developers**
- Conducted training sessions for developers unfamiliar with Docker, covering containerization basics and best practices.

### 10. **Linux Advocacy for Development**
- Encouraged developers to transition from Windows to Linux to gain better visibility and control over server operations.

### 11. **Promoting Code Review Culture & Best Practices**
- Advocated for regular code reviews to improve code quality and maintainability.
- Encouraged the use of environment variables for security and easier deployments.

### 12. **Project Documentation & Awareness**
- Guided developers to understand all aspects of the project beyond their immediate tasks.
- Introduced the practice of creating technical documentation, including:
  - Network diagrams
  - Deployment diagrams
  - System architecture documentation

## CI/CD Progress & Automation

### 13. **CI/CD Implementation Using Jenkins**
- Set up Jenkins pipelines for automating the deployment process, reducing manual intervention and improving deployment efficiency.
- Integrated Jenkins with GitLab for seamless code integration and automated builds.

### 14. **Ansible for Server Configuration Management**
- Implemented Ansible to automate the configuration of different servers, ensuring consistency and reducing setup time.
- Created Ansible playbooks for provisioning, security hardening, and application deployment.

### 15. **Enhancing Dockerization & Image Optimization**
- Working on making Docker images more flexible and multi-layered for better performance and maintainability.
- Implementing build optimizations to reduce image size and improve container startup times.

### 16. **Nginx Performance Tuning & Load Testing**
- Conducted load testing on the production environment to identify bottlenecks and optimize Nginx configurations.
- Fine-tuning Nginx settings to improve request handling, caching, and compression for better performance.

### 17. **Monitoring & Metrics Analysis**
- Integrated Jaeger, Prometheus, and Grafana for monitoring and analyzing system performance.
- Using collected metrics to optimize infrastructure and improve system reliability.

## Conclusion
The past 1.5 months have been focused on improving the DevOps culture, enhancing deployment strategies, and fostering better collaboration among developers. Moving forward, I aim to further optimize CI/CD pipelines, improve monitoring and logging systems, and continue promoting best practices across all teams.
